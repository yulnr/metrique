//! Traits for aggregation
//!
//! This module provides a composable aggregation system with three main layers:
//!
//! ## Field-level aggregation: [`AggregateValue`]
//!
//! Defines how individual field values are merged. For example, [`crate::value::Sum`] sums values,
//! while [`crate::histogram::Histogram`] collects values into distributions. This trait enables
//! compile-time type resolution:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use metrique_aggregation::value::Sum;
//! use metrique_aggregation::traits::AggregateValue;
//! type AggregatedType = <Sum as AggregateValue<u64>>::Aggregated;
//! //                     ^^^                   ^^
//! //                     Strategy              Input type
//! ```
//!
//! ## Entry-level aggregation: [`Merge`] and [`AggregateStrategy`]
//!
//! The [`Merge`] trait defines how complete metric entries are combined. It specifies:
//! - The accumulated type (`Merged`)
//! - How to create new accumulators (`new_merged`)
//! - How to merge entries into accumulators (`merge`)
//!
//! The [`AggregateStrategy`] trait ties together a source type with its merge behavior and
//! key extraction strategy. The `#[aggregate]` macro generates these implementations automatically.
//!
//! ## Key extraction: [`Key`]
//!
//! The [`Key`] trait extracts grouping keys from source entries, enabling keyed aggregation
//! where entries with the same key are merged together. Fields marked with `#[aggregate(key)]`
//! become part of the key.
//!
//! ## The [`crate::aggregator::Aggregate`] wrapper
//!
//! [`crate::aggregator::Aggregate`] is the simplest way to aggregate data, typically used as a field in a larger struct.
//! It wraps an aggregated value and tracks the number of samples merged.

/// Defines how individual field values are aggregated.
///
/// This trait operates at the field level, not the entry level. Each aggregation
/// strategy (Counter, Histogram, etc.) implements this trait for the types it can aggregate.
///
/// # Type Parameters
///
/// - `T`: The type of value being aggregated
///
/// # Associated Types
///
/// - `Aggregated`: The accumulated type (often same as `T`, but can differ for histograms)
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use metrique_aggregation::traits::AggregateValue;
/// use metrique_core::CloseValue;
///
/// // Average tracks sum and count to compute average
/// pub struct Avg;
///
/// pub struct AvgAccumulator {
///     sum: f64,
///     count: u64,
/// }
///
/// impl CloseValue for AvgAccumulator {
///     type Closed = f64;
///
///     fn close(self) -> f64 {
///         if self.count == 0 {
///             0.0
///         } else {
///             self.sum / self.count as f64
///         }
///     }
/// }
///
/// impl AggregateValue<f64> for Avg {
///     type Aggregated = AvgAccumulator;
///
///     fn insert(accum: &mut Self::Aggregated, value: f64) {
///         accum.sum += value;
///         accum.count += 1;
///     }
/// }
/// ```
pub trait AggregateValue<T> {
    /// The accumulated type (often same as T, but can differ for histograms).
    type Aggregated;

    /// Aggregate a value into the accumulator.
    fn insert(accum: &mut Self::Aggregated, value: T);
}

/// Key extraction trait for aggregation strategies.
///
/// Extracts grouping keys from source entries to enable keyed aggregation. Entries with
/// the same key are merged together. The `#[aggregate]` macro generates implementations
/// for fields marked with `#[aggregate(key)]`.
///
/// # Type Parameters
///
/// - `Source`: The type being aggregated
///
/// # Associated Types
///
/// - `Key<'a>`: The key type with lifetime parameter for borrowed data
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use metrique::unit_of_work::metrics;
/// use metrique_aggregation::traits::Key;
/// use std::borrow::Cow;
///
/// struct ApiCall {
///     endpoint: String,
///     latency: u64,
/// }
///
/// #[derive(Clone, Hash, PartialEq, Eq)]
/// #[metrics]
/// struct ApiCallKey<'a> {
///     endpoint: Cow<'a, String>,
/// }
///
/// struct ApiCallByEndpoint;
///
/// impl Key<ApiCall> for ApiCallByEndpoint {
///     type Key<'a> = ApiCallKey<'a>;
///
///     fn from_source(source: &ApiCall) -> Self::Key<'_> {
///         ApiCallKey {
///             endpoint: Cow::Borrowed(&source.endpoint),
///         }
///     }
///
///     fn static_key<'a>(key: &Self::Key<'a>) -> Self::Key<'static> {
///         ApiCallKey {
///             endpoint: Cow::Owned(key.endpoint.clone().into_owned()),
///         }
///     }
///
///     fn static_key_matches<'a>(owned: &Self::Key<'static>, borrowed: &Self::Key<'a>) -> bool {
///         owned.endpoint == borrowed.endpoint
///     }
/// }
/// ```

    fn from_source(source: &Source) -> Self::Key<'_>;
    /// Convert borrowed key to static lifetime
    fn static_key<'a>(key: &Self::Key<'a>) -> Self::Key<'static>;

    /// Compare the static and reference versions of the key for equality.
    ///
    /// Why not use Equivalent or another trait?

    /// - You can implement this by doing `owned == borrowed` on your concrete type, however the bounds seem hard to express

/// Defines how complete metric entries are merged together.
///
/// This trait operates at the entry level, combining entire structs rather than individual fields.
/// The `#[aggregate]` macro generates implementations that merge each field according to its
/// `#[aggregate(strategy = ...)]` attribute.
///
/// # Type Parameters
///
/// - `Self`: The source type being aggregated
///
/// # Associated Types
///
/// - `Merged`: The accumulated type that holds aggregated values
/// - `MergeConfig`: Configuration needed to create new merged values (often `()`)
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use metrique::unit_of_work::metrics;
/// use metrique_aggregation::traits::Merge;
/// use metrique_aggregation::histogram::Histogram;
/// use std::time::Duration;
///
/// struct ApiCall {
///     latency: Duration,
