//! which are a rendezvous points between metric sources and metric sinks.
//!
//! Note that [`GlobalEntrySink`]s involve boxing, since the types of the [`Entry`]
//! and the [`EntrySink`] are kept separate until run-time. This is implemented in a fairly
//! high-performance manner.
//!
//! However, applications with a very high metric emission rate might prefer to have their
//! high-rate metrics go directly to an [`EntrySink`] without any boxing - and as high-rate
//! metrics are often the per-request metrics from the data plane of a service, and it is
//! often a good idea to separate these from other service metrics for many reasons, even
//! ignoring the boxing performance issue.
